===================

Simple web page to send internet radio streams to the Rocki wireless music player

**This project is no longer being actively maintained.**

I'm no longer using my Rocki audio player, so I won't be able to (easily) test with new firmware versions. Also, Rocki needs to add radio support to the official app, and not rely on 3rd party developers to provide workarounds.
